<h1>Responsible Buy Now, Pay Later</h1>
<h2>Embedding Long-Term Financial Responsibility into Short-Term Consumption</h2>

<p>
<strong>Author:</strong> Adam Schofield<br>
<strong>Status:</strong> Concept White Paper<br>
<strong>Date:</strong> 19 January 2026
</p>

<p>
This site hosts the original white paper outlining <em>Responsible BNPL</em> — a
behaviourally-aligned redesign of Buy Now, Pay Later systems in which the
<strong>first payment is diverted into a ring-fenced Future Self Fund</strong>,
accumulating across purchases for long-term outcomes such as housing deposits
or retirement savings.
</p>

<p>
The paper is published publicly to establish authorship, invite critique, and
contribute constructively to discussions around financial literacy, consumer
protection, and responsible credit design.
